    <h1>Happy Birthday, Baby! </h1>
    <p>happy birthday. I really wish that i was there with you right now, making sure you feel as special as you are to me. i wanna be the one planning your day, spoiling you, making you feel like the most important person in the world; because you are. but since i can’t be there, at least we’re under the same moon, right? and if not this time, then the next, because i know, without a doubt, that we’re meant for each other.</p>
    
    <p>i don’t know why, but lately, i feel like i love you even more than before. i mean, i always have, but recently, it’s been so much that i don’t even know what to do with myself. i catch myself thinking about you all the time; about us, about our future, about finally meeting you. and the more i think about it, the more i just know you’re it for me.</p>
    
    <p>my favorite part of every single day is getting to talk to you. no matter how tired, stressed, or drained i am, hearing your voice, texting you, or even just knowing you’re there makes everything feel okay. i don’t think you realize just how much you mean to me. you’re my safe place, my happiness, my everything.</p>
    
    <p>i just wanna be with you already. wanna hold you, wanna kiss you every minute of every day, wanna make up for all the time we’ve spent apart. i wanna give you the kind of love that makes you feel so safe, so wanted, so completely mine that you never have to question a thing.</p>
    
    <p>i love you, baby. happy birthday. i hope today is everything you deserve and more, because you deserve the absolute best; always.</p>
